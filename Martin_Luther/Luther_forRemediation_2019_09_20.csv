In this tract, Luther confesses that he believes that Jesus was born a Jew of the Virgin Mary.  He also hopes that his teaching will bring more Jews to convert to Christianity.  In his view, the teaching and practice of many who came before him, as well as of his opponents, was the chief cause that most Jews did not convert.

It is a searching treatment of key theological and ethical issues such as freedom and grace, and religious quandaries such as: if a person is ""justified"" or ""saved"" by grace apart from any works he or she might do, what is the point of living a moral life? Luther’s language is often paradoxical, as for example in its famous opening line: ""A Christian is the most free lord of all, and subject to none; a Christian is the most dutiful servant of all, and subject to everyone."" and: ""Here is the truly Christian life, here is faith really working by love, when a man applies himself with joy and love to the works of that freest servitude in which he serves others voluntarily and for nothing, himself abundantly satisfied in the fullness and riches of his own faith."" One historian has recently summarized a key message of this work in contemporary, colloquial terms: Luther ""told a sound psychological truth: Relationships of love are not played by rules.""",,,,,

In particular, he attacks the Church’s doctrine, which drew on Aristotelian categories, of the ""transubstantiation"" of bread and wine at Communion, instead insisting that ""the Holy Spirit is greater than Aristotle."" The work articulates ideas that would come to define many Protestant traditions, but also prove to be sources of ongoing division among them. ",,,,,

In truth, since you alone are everywhere considered as being the cause of my engaging in war, I cannot at any time fail to remember you; and although I have been compelled by the causeless raging of your impious flatterers against me to appeal from your seat to a future council...yet I have never been so alienated in feeling from your Blessedness as not to have sought with all my might, in diligent prayer and crying to God, all the best gifts for you and for your see.

He called for the end of major swathes of the medieval Church’s structure, including its elaborate calendar of feasts and saints days, and its vast industry of relics and pilgrimages. Among his demands was the abolition of clerical celibacy, arguing that to prohibit marriage was as futile as to ""forbid eating, drinking, the natural movement of the bowels or growing fat."" Though addressed primarily to non-ecclesiastical elites – whose support and protection were perhaps the main reason he survived through this period – the work uses populist rhetoric against the hierarchy of Church structures and teaching. It was reprinted at least fourteen times within just a few years.  ""Therefore…those who are now called ‘spiritual’ – priests, bishops, or popes – are neither different from other Christians, nor superior to them….""  ""...there is no true, basic difference between laymen and priests, princes and bishops, between religious and secular, except for the sake of office and work, but not for the sake of status….they all of the spiritual estate, all are truly priests, bishops, and popes.""  ""...it may well happen that the pope and his followers are wicked men and not true Christians, not taught of God, not having true understanding. On the other hand, an ordinary man may have true understanding; why then should we not follow him?""",,,,,

This anonymous 14th century mystical work enjoined union with God and self-renunciation and was a favorite of Luther’s. In addition to its theology, the fact that it was written in German energized Luther’s view that vernacular language could be a suitable medium for the transcendent. From the preface: ""...I will have every one warned who reads this little book, that he should not take offence, to his own hurt, at its bad German, or its crabbed and uncouth words. For this noble book, though it be poor and rude in words, is so much the richer and more precious in knowledge and divine wisdom…Let as many as will, read this little book, and then say whether theology is a new or an old thing among us; for this book is not new. But if they say as before, that we are but German theologians, we will not deny it. I thank God, that I have heard and found my God in the German tongue, as neither I nor they have yet found Him in the Latin, Greek, or Hebrew tongue. God grant that this book may be spread abroad, then we shall find that the German theologians are without doubt the best theologians.""",,,,,

This work summarizes the debate that occurred in Leipzig between Luther and his opponents.

The event, during which Luther asserted that ""scripture alone"" (sola scriptura) rather than the Roman Church or the Pope, was the supreme authority for Christians, marked a turning point in Luther’s relation to the Church of which he was then, still, a member. Soon after, the papal bull Exsurge Domine was issued, condemning Luther’s writings and setting the stage for his excommunication.",,,,,

To meet the demand, many of Luther’s works were printed or re-printed in other cities with more developed printing industries such as Leipzig, Augsburg, Basel, and (as here) Nuremberg.  The sermon’s final passage captures the combative tone that would characterize some of Luther’s polemical works: ""...some people reproach me as a heretic (for such a truth is quite injurious for their money boxes), I pay little heed to such babblings [and the only ones who do are] some muddled brains who have never sniffed a Bible, have never read the Christian teachers, have never understood their own teachers but rather are decaying in their riddled and fragmented opinions.
